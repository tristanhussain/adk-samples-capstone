    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent Development Kit [(ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) is a flexible and modular framework that applies software development principles to AI agent creation. It is designed to simplify building, deploying, and orchestrating agent workflows, from simple tasks to complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional software with clear pass/fail unit tests, LLM agents, due to their probabilistic nature, require a more nuanced evaluation/testing approach. ADK helps you manage this probablistic behavior and enables you to [evaluate/test](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/) Agents not only for their final output, but also the path they took to achieve that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This Colab notebook demonstrates how you can evaluate/test your Agents using various criteria using CLI. It covers following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "  *   `tool_trajectory_avg_score`: Compares agent's tool calls with expected trajectory.\n",
    "  *   `response_match_score`: Evaluates final response similarity using Rouge-1.\n",
    "  *   `final_response_match_v2`: Assesses semantic equivalence of responses using an LLM judge.\n",
    "  *   `rubric_based_final_response_quality_v1`: Evaluates response quality against user-defined rubrics with an LLM judge.\n",
    "  *   `rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1`: Assesses tool usage quality against user-defined rubrics with an LLM judge.\n",
    "  *   `hallucinations_v1`: Checks for false, contradictory, or unsupported claims in agent responses.\n",
    "  *   `safety_v1`: Evaluates the harmlessness of agent responses using Vertex AI General AI Eval SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will understand how to set up and run comprehensive evaluations for your ADK Agents."

    "\n",
    "#### Details\n",
    "\n",
    "For each invocation that is being evaluated, this criterion compares the list of\n",
    "tool calls produced by the agent against the list of expected tool calls. The\n",
    "comparison is done by performing an exact match on the tool name and tool\n",
    "arguments for each tool call in the list. If all tool calls in an invocation\n",
    "match exactly in content and order, a score of 1.0 is awarded for that\n",
    "invocation, otherwise the score is 0.0. The final value is the average of these\n",
    "scores across all invocations in the eval case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output And How To Interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is a score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates a perfect match\n",
    "between actual and expected tool trajectories for all invocations, and 0.0\n",
    "indicates a complete mismatch for all invocations. Higher scores are better. A\n",
    "score below 1.0 means that for at least one invocation, the agent's tool call\n",
    "trajectory deviated from the expected one.\n",
    "\n",

    "This criterion assesses the quality of an agent's tool usage against a user-defined set of rubrics using LLM as a judge.\n",
    "#### Details\n",
    "This criterion provides a flexible way to evaluate tool usage based on specific rules that you define as rubrics. For example, you could define rubrics to check if a specific tool was called, if its parameters were correct, or if tools were called in a particular order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The criterion uses an LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the agent's tool calls and responses against each rubric, producing a yes (1.0) or no (0.0) verdict for each. Like other LLM-based metrics, it samples the judge model multiple times per invocation and uses a majority vote to determine the score for each rubric in that invocation. The overall score for an invocation is the average of its rubric scores. The final criterion score for the eval case is the average of these overall scores across all invocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output And How To Interpret\n",
    "The criterion outputs an overall score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates that the agent's tool usage satisfied all rubrics across all invocations, and 0.0 indicates that no rubrics were satisfied. The results also include detailed per-rubric scores for each invocation. Higher values are better.\n",

    "This means the agent achieved a perfect score of 1.0, meeting or exceeding the set threshold of 0.8. The `rubric_based_tool_use_quality_v1` criterion uses an LLM as a judge to assess the quality of the agent's tool usage against user-defined rubrics. In this case, both rubrics — \"roll_dice tool is only called when user prompt asks for a dice roll.\" and \"check_prime is only called when user prompt asks for a prime number.\" — received a perfect score of 1.0 across all invocations. This demonstrates that the agent's tool usage successfully adhered to the defined rules as evaluated by the LLM judge.
