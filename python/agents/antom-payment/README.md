### Alternative: Using Agent Starter Pack

You can also use the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to create a production-ready version of this agent with additional deployment options:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-parallel-task-decomposition-agent -a adk@parallel-task-decomposition-agent
```

<summary>⚡️ Alternative: Using uv</summary>

If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can create and set up your project with a single command:

```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-parallel-task-decomposition-agent -a adk@parallel-task-decomposition-agent
```

This command handles creating the project without needing to pre-install the package into a virtual environment.
