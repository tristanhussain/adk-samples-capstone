### ✨ Key Features

The Cyber Guardian Agent leverages a **hierarchical multi-agent architecture** built on Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to automate incident triage, investigation, and response.

#### 🧠 1. Orchestration & Routing
*   **Orchestrator Agent**: Acts as the central brain. It parses raw alert data (e.g., EDR detections, Phishing emails, IOC matches) and manages the execution flow.
*   **Dynamic Paths**: It intelligently reroutes the investigation path based on evidence. For instance, it runs **Threat Intel** *before* **Investigation** for IOC alerts, but *after* **Investigation** for process-heavy EDR alerts to verify newly discovered indicators.

#### 🛠️ 2. Specialized Python Tools
*   **Native Python Integration**: All forensic and investigative tools are implemented as standard Python functions, integrated via ADK's `FunctionTool`. This ensures low latency and seamless data passing between agents.
*   **BigQuery Integration**: Tools are optimized to query high-capacity BigQuery tables for logs, asset inventory, and threat intelligence, effectively serving as a high-speed RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) source for security context.

#### 👥 3. Specialized Sub-Agents
*   **Triage Agent**: Handles deduplication and context enrichment. It queries asset inventory to determine if the target is a high-criticality asset.
*   **Investigation Agent**: Digs deep into process and network logs to confirm the blast radius and derive new Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
*   **Threat Intel Agent**: Performs batch lookups on file hashes, IPs, and domains against a threat intelligence knowledge base.
*   **Response Agent**: Maps findings to predefined playbooks and recommends surgical response actions.

#### 🤝 4. Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) Safety
*   **Guardrails**: Critical response actions (e.g., host isolation) are flagged to require explicit approval, ensuring that automation supports rather than replaces expert judgment.

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` matches your actual GCP project ID where the BigQuery tables are hosted.

---

### 📊 Optional: Populate BigQuery Tables

If you are setting up the environment for the first time, you can populate the required BigQuery tables using the provided CSV files in the `sample_data/` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The data in `sample_data/` is synthetically generated for demonstration purposes.


**1. Create the BigQuery Dataset**
```bash
# Ensure environment variables are set or replaced directly
bq --location=US mk --dataset ${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}:${BQ_DATASET}
```

**2. Load Data from CSV Files**
```bash
bq load --autodetect --source_format=CSV ${BQ_DATASET}.asset_inventory ./sample_data/asset_inventory.csv
bq load --autodetect --source_format=CSV ${BQ_DATASET}.endpoint_process_events ./sample_data/endpoint_process_events.csv

## D. Customization & Extension

The Cyber Guardian Agent is designed to be extensible. Whether you want to add new investigation capabilities or change the underlying data sources, here is how you can hack on the project.

### 🧠 1. Modifying the Agent Flow & Logic

The intelligence and routing logic of the system are determined by the orchestrator.

*   **Tweak Prompts**: To change how agents behave or interpret alerts, edit the instructions in `cyber_guardian/prompt.py` (for the Orchestrator) or the `prompt.py` files within each sub-agent directory (e.g., `cyber_guardian/sub_agents/triage/prompt.py`).
*   **Alter Orchestration**: The root agent definition and its sub-agent list are located in `cyber_guardian/agent.py`. Adjust the `sub_agents` list or the agent's model selection here.
*   **Add New Intents**: If you want the agent to handle new types of alerts (e.g., "Network Anomaly"), update the "Step 1: Parse & Classify" section in `cyber_guardian/prompt.py`.

### 🛠️ 2. Adding New Tools & APIs

The agents interact with the world through Python function tools.

*   **Define Functions**: Create new Python functions in `cyber_guardian/tools.py`. These functions should return JSON-serializable strings for the agents to consume.
*   **Plug in External APIs**: You can easily integrate tools for Virustotal, CrowdStrike, or Jira by adding their SDK calls within a new tool function.
*   **Register Tools**: To make a tool available to an agent, import it into the relevant agent's file (e.g., `sub_agents/investigation/agent.py`) and add it to the `tools` list via `FunctionTool(your_new_tool)`.

### 📊 3. Changing Data Sources (RAG)

The agent currently treats BigQuery as its primary source of truth (RAG).

*   **Switch Datasets**: You can point the entire system to a different BigQuery dataset by updating the `BQ_DATASET` variable in your `.env` file.
*   **Modify Database Queries**: If your schema differs from the default, update the SQL queries within the tool functions in `cyber_guardian/tools.py`.
*   **Use Different Backends**: While optimized for BigQuery, you can swap the database logic in `tools.py` to query Elasticsearch, Splunk, or local JSON/CSV files by changing the internally called Python libraries.

## E. Evaluation

Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the Cyber Guardian Agent is critical before deploying it in a live SecOps environment. While the Agent Development Kit (ADK) focuses on agent orchestration, we implement a custom evaluation framework located in the `/eval/` directory.

### 🧪 Evaluation Methodology

Our evaluation methodology treats the multi-agent system as a complete pipeline, measuring its performance against a curated dataset of historical alerts ("ground truth" dataset). We evaluate both the intermediate steps (sub-agent performance) and the final outcome (orchestrator synthesis).

**The process involves:**
1.  **Dataset Ingestion**: Feeding a test suite of raw alerts (Phishing, EDR triggers, IOC matches, and benign anomalies) into the system.
2.  **Execution Logging**: Tracing the agent's routing decisions, tool calls, and payload arguments.
3.  **Assertion Checking**: Comparing the agent's generated response plan and derived IOCs against manually verified analyst playbooks.

### 📈 Key Metrics

When running evaluations, we care about the following metrics:
*   **Routing Accuracy**: Did the Orchestrator choose the correct sub-agent path (e.g., calling Threat Intel *before* Investigation for an IOC alert)?
*   **Entity Extraction Recall**: Did the agents successfully extract all relevant entities (IPs, hashes, hostnames) from the raw text to pass into the Python tools?
*   **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: How often did the system recommend a disruptive action (e.g., host isolation) for a benign or duplicate alert?
*   **Tool Execution Success Target**: What percentage of BigQuery tool invocations resulted in valid SQL execution vs. malformed queries or API errors?

## G. Testing the Deployed Agent

After successfully deploying the Cyber Guardian Agent, you can test it using one of the following methods depending on your deployment target.

### Option 1: Web Interface (If deployed to Cloud Run with UI)

If you deployed the agent to Cloud Run with the UI enabled, you can interact with it directly in your browser:

1. Locate the Cloud Run service URL from the deployment output or the Google Cloud Console.
2. Open the URL in your browser.
3. Paste one of the sample inputs from `sample_input.txt` into the chat box to trigger the investigation workflow.

### Option 2: Testing via cURL (Cloud Run Endpoint)

If the agent is deployed as a web service on Cloud Run, you can test it by sending a POST request to the endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer \$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
  -d '{
    "message": "SCH_SR_Falcon_Detection/Host:winsrv0221\n\nUser system on Host winsrv0221 Which is a WINDOWS Server 2022 Server with an IP of 10.20.3.16 alerted for A suspicious process tree was observed. Host Impacted: winsrv0221 User Impacted: system.\nIOC: 45.146.164.110 (IP)"
  }'
```

*Note: Replace `https://YOUR_CLOUD_RUN_URL` with your actual service URL. The endpoint might be `/predict` or `/chat` depending on your setup.*

### Option 3: Testing via Vertex AI SDK (If deployed as Reasoning Engine)

If you deployed the agent to Vertex AI Reasoning Engine (Agent Engine), you can test it using the Python SDK:

```python
from google.cloud import aiplatform

# Initialize the SDK
aiplatform.init(
    project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    location="YOUR_LOCATION"
)

# Load the remote agent
# Replace RESOURCE_ID with your deployed reasoning engine ID
remote_agent = aiplatform.ReasoningEngine(
    "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/YOUR_LOCATION/reasoningEngines/RESOURCE_ID"
)

# Test the agent
response = remote_agent.predict(
    input="SCH_SR_Falcon_Detection/Host:winsrv0221 ... (paste full alert text)"
)

print(response)
```
